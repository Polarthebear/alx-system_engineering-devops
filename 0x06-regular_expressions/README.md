### Brief Description
Regular expressions, often referred to as regex, are powerful patterns used in Ruby and system DevOps for string matching and manipulation. In Ruby, they are implemented through the Regexp class and provide a concise and flexible way to search, match, and manipulate text based on specific patterns. In the context of system DevOps, regex is frequently employed in tools and scripts to parse and process log files, configuration files, and other text-based data. It enables efficient pattern matching and extraction of relevant information, contributing to the automation and efficiency of system administration tasks.
